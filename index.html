<h3 id="算法过程"><a href="#算法过程" class="headerlink" title="算法过程"></a>算法过程</h3><ol>
<li>初始化：构造一个10*n的二维数组，一个长度为n的数组用于存储每次位排序时每个桶子里有多</li>
</ol>
<p>少个元素。</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>循环操作：从低位开始，将所有元素对应该位的数字存到相应的桶子里去（对应二维数组的那一</li>
</ol>
<p>列）。然后将所有桶子里的元素按照桶子标号从小到大取出，对于同一个桶子里的元素，先放进去的</p>
<p>先取出，后放进去的后取出（保证排序稳定性）。这样原数组就按该位排序完毕了，继续下一位操作</p>
